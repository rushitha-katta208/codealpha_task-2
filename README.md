# 💬 Basic Chatbot

A simple rule-based chatbot built for educational and demonstration purposes. This project showcases how a basic chatbot can interact with users using predefined responses.

## 🚀 Features

- Rule-based conversation flow
- Simple pattern recognition
- Easy to modify and expand
- Command-line interface

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Language: Python 3.x  
- No external dependencies required

## 📁 Project Structure

basic-chatbot/ │ ├── chatbot.py         # Main chatbot logic ├── intents.json       # Predefined patterns and responses └── README.md          # Project documentation

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User inputs a message.
2. The chatbot checks for matching patterns.
3. Returns a predefined response based on the match.

This chatbot does *not* use NLP or machine learning. It’s built using basic if-else or keyword-matching logic.

## ▶ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/basic-chatbot.git
cd basic-chatbot

2. Run the Bot

python chatbot.py

3. Sample Interaction

You: Hello
Bot: Hi there! How can I help you?

You: Bye
Bot: Goodbye! Have a great day.

🧩 Example intents.json

{
  "intents": [
    {
      "pattern": ["hello", "hi", "hey"],
      "response": "Hi there! How can I help you?"
    },
    {
      "pattern": ["bye", "goodbye"],
      "response": "Goodbye! Have a great day."
    }
  ]
}
