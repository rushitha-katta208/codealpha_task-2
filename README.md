# 🤖 Basic Python Chatbot

This is a simple rule-based chatbot built using Python. It demonstrates how basic conversational logic can be implemented without the use of complex AI or machine learning models.

## 📌 Features

- Simple keyword-based response system
- Beginner-friendly Python code
- Easily extendable for learning and prototyping

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Standard Python libraries only (no external dependencies)

## 📁 Project Structure

basic-python-chatbot/ │ ├── chatbot.py         # Main chatbot logic ├── intents.json       # Contains chatbot patterns and responses └── README.md          # Project documentation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system  
- Basic knowledge of Python (variables, loops, conditionals, functions)

### 🔧 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rushitha-katta208/basic-python-chatbot.git
   cd basic-python-chatbot

2. Run the chatbot:

python chatbot.py



💬 Example Interaction

You: hello
Bot: Hello! How can I help you today?

You: bye
Bot: Goodbye! Have a nice day.

📂 intents.json (Example)

{
  "intents": [
    {
      "patterns": ["hello", "hi", "hey"],
      "response": "Hello! How can I help you today?"
    },
    {
      "patterns": ["bye", "goodbye"],
      "response": "Goodbye! Have a nice day."
    },
    {
      "patterns": ["how are you"],
      "response": "I'm just a bot, but I'm doing fine. Thanks for asking!"
    }
  ]
}

🧠 How It Works

The chatbot loads intents.json.

When you enter a message, it checks for a matching keyword or phrase.

It then replies with the corresponding response.

If no match is found, it gives a default fallback message.


📈 Future Improvements

Add Natural Language Processing (NLP) using NLTK or spaCy

Use machine learning for intent classification

Create a web-based or GUI interface
